# Process Retrospective

## What This Does

Analyses the development process since the last retro (or project start) and produces a process improvement report. Covers: what was accomplished, what went well, what needs improving, and concrete actions to take.

## Instructions

### 1. Gather data

Read the following sources to build a picture of recent work:

- **Session logs** — Read all files in `docs/sessions/` since the last retro (or all if this is the first retro after setup). These capture completed work, decisions, and conversation summaries.
- **Git history** — Run `git log --oneline` to see commit frequency, message quality, and whether atomic commits per task are happening.
- **GitHub Issues** — Run `gh issue list --state all --json number,title,state,labels` to assess backlog health: are labels being used? Are blocked/ready states accurate? Are issues being closed with proper DoD?
- **Project board** — Run `gh project item-list 2 --owner mironyx` to check priority ordering and status accuracy.
- **Drift reports** — Read any drift reports in `docs/reports/` generated since the last retro. Are critical items being resolved promptly?
- **Previous retro** — Read the most recent `docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-process-retro.md` if one exists, to check whether previous actions were implemented.

### 2. Assess process health

Evaluate against these dimensions:

| Dimension | What to look for |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Backlog hygiene** | Are issues labelled (`ready`/`blocked`/`in-progress`)? Is priority ordering maintained? Are dependencies explicit? |
| **Definition of done** | Are issues being closed with all DoD checklist items ticked? Or are cross-references and drift checks being skipped? |
| **Commit discipline** | One commit per completed task? Conventional commit messages with issue references? Untracked files at session end? |
| **Session continuity** | Are session logs being written? Do they contain all four sections (completed work, decisions, summary, next guidance)? Is the next session able to orient quickly? |
| **Drift management** | Is drift scan being run at session end and before level transitions? Are critical drift items being resolved within one session? |
| **Multi-agent readiness** | Are tasks scoped to single files? Are cross-reference updates deferred as follow-up issues? Could a second agent pick up a `ready` issue and work independently? |

### 3. Write the report

Save to `docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-process-retro.md` using this structure:

```markdown
# Process Retrospective

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Period:** [date of last retro or project start] to today
**Sessions reviewed:** [list session numbers/dates]

## What went well

- [Things that worked — keep doing these]

## What needs improving

- [Problems observed, with evidence from the data gathered]

## Actions from previous retro

| Action | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| [action from last retro] | Done / Partial / Not started | [what happened] |

## New actions

| # | Action | Addresses |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | [concrete action] | [which problem] |

## Process health scorecard

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Backlog hygiene | Green / Amber / Red | [brief explanation] |
| Definition of done | Green / Amber / Red | |
| Commit discipline | Green / Amber / Red | |
| Session continuity | Green / Amber / Red | |
| Drift management | Green / Amber / Red | |
| Multi-agent readiness | Green / Amber / Red | |
```

### 4. Summarise

Present the user with:
- The health scorecard
- Top 3 actions to take
- Comparison with previous retro (if one exists)
- The file path to the full report

## When to Run

- At the end of each project phase (Phase 0 → Phase 1 transition, etc.)
- After every 3-5 sessions of active work
- When the user feels the process is drifting or unclear
- Before starting multi-agent parallel work for the first time

## Cadence

This retro should be run regularly. Add a reminder to the session end protocol: if 3+ sessions have passed since the last retro, suggest running `/retro` before continuing with feature work.
