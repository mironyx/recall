# Feature Team — Parallel Implementation via Agent Teams

Implements multiple features in parallel. The lead defines high-level tasks and coordinates;
each teammate is a fully autonomous Claude Code session responsible for its own git isolation,
TDD implementation, and PR creation.

**Requires:** Claude Code CLI with `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` enabled.
Not supported in VS Code.

**Usage:**
- `/feature-team 101 102 103` — implement three specific task issues in parallel
- `/feature-team -n 3` — implement the top 3 Todo task items from the project board
- `/feature-team epic 45` — implement all tasks from epic #45 in parallel

For a single issue, use `/feature` instead. Epic issues (label `epic`) cannot be implemented directly — pass task issues or use `epic <N>` mode.

## Lead Process

Execute these steps sequentially without pausing for confirmation.

### Step 1: Parse arguments and collect issues

If `epic <N>` is given:
1. Read the epic issue: `gh issue view <N> --json title,body,labels`.
2. Verify it has the `epic` label. If not, stop: "Issue #N is not an epic."
3. Parse the task checklist from the body. Extract all unchecked task issue numbers.
4. If no unchecked tasks, stop: "Epic #N has no remaining tasks."

If `-n N` is given:
```bash
gh project item-list 2 --owner mironyx --format json \
  | python3 -c "
import json, sys
items = json.load(sys.stdin)['items']
todo = [i for i in items if i.get('status') == 'Todo']
for i in todo[:N]:
    print(i['content']['number'])
"
```

If explicit issue numbers are given: use them directly.

**Epic guard:** For all modes, check each collected issue for the `epic` label. If any issue is an epic, stop: "Issue #N is an epic, not a task. Use `/feature-team epic <N>` to implement its tasks."

For each issue number, read the title and design reference:
```bash
gh issue view <N> --json title,body,labels
```

### Step 2: Validate each issue

For each issue confirm:
- Design reference present (LLD section, design doc, or ADR path in the issue body)
- Acceptance criteria defined

If any issue fails: report which one and stop. Do not proceed with a partial set.

### Step 3: Create shared task list

Create one task per issue:
- Title: `Implement issue #<N> — <title>`
- State: pending

### Step 4: Spawn teammates

**Two-step pattern — always follow this exact sequence:**

1. Call `TeamCreate` to create the team record:
   ```
   TeamCreate(team_name="feature-team-<issues>", description="...")
   ```
   If `TeamCreate` returns "already leading team", read
   `~/.claude/teams/<name>/config.json`. If `members` contains only the lead (no
   teammates), the team was created but teammates were never spawned — proceed directly
   to step 2. If teammates are already present, do not recreate.

2. Call `Agent` once per teammate, **all in the same message**, with `team_name` and
   `name` set:
   ```
   Agent(team_name="feature-team-<issues>", name="teammate-<N>", run_in_background=true, prompt="...")
   Agent(team_name="feature-team-<issues>", name="teammate-<M>", run_in_background=true, prompt="...")
   ```

Do **not** pass "Create a team with N teammates" as prose to the `Agent` tool — that
syntax is not supported and will be echoed back as text rather than spawning teammates.

**Pre-requisite:** Teammates inherit the lead's permission mode — there is no per-teammate
override at spawn time. For teammates to run fully autonomously without prompting, the lead
session **must** have been started with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

If the lead was not started this way, teammates will prompt for every tool use and parallel
execution breaks down. Stop, restart the lead with the flag, and re-run `/feature-team`.

Each teammate receives this self-contained prompt (fill in the placeholders):

> You are implementing issue #N: TITLE
>
> Steps:
> 1. Create your own branch and worktree:
>    ```bash
>    SLUG=<slug-from-title>
>    git fetch origin main
>    git worktree add ../fcs-feat-<N>-$SLUG -b feat/$SLUG origin/main
>    cd ../fcs-feat-<N>-$SLUG
>    ```
> 1a. Symlink gitignored local files from the main repo so integration tests work:
>    ```bash
>    MAIN_REPO=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir | python3 -c "import sys,os; print(os.path.dirname(sys.stdin.read().strip()))")
>    for f in .env.test.local; do
>      [ -f "$MAIN_REPO/$f" ] && ln -sf "$MAIN_REPO/$f" "$f"
>    done
>    ```
> 2. Tag your session (must run AFTER worktree is set up so /proc detects the correct JSONL):
>    ```bash
>    .claude/hooks/run-python.sh scripts/tag-session.py <N>
>    ```
> 3. Move issue to In Progress:
>    ```bash
>    bash scripts/gh-project-status.sh add <N> "in progress"
>    ```
> 4. Run `/feature-core <N>`. This covers everything from reading the design through PR
>    creation and review. Follow all coding principles in CLAUDE.md. Do not ask for
>    confirmation between steps.
> 5. Report back to the lead with the PR URL and wait — **do not exit**.
> 6. When the lead sends you a feature-end message, run `/feature-end <N>`.
>    **Follow every step in `/feature-end` without skipping — especially lld-sync (Step 1.5)
>    and session log (Step 2). These are mandatory.**

### Step 5: Monitor

Teammates notify the lead automatically when idle (PR created or blocked).

If a teammate reports a blocker: relay it to the user without interrupting other teammates.
Do not shut down the team on a single failure.

### Step 6: Report PRs and wait

When all teammates have reported their PR URLs, summarise:
- Each issue → branch → PR URL
- Any blockers or deferred findings per teammate

**Do NOT send shutdown_request yet.** Teammates stay alive in their panes, waiting for feature-end.

When the user runs `/feature-end <N>` in the lead pane, forward it to the relevant teammate
via SendMessage: "Please run `/feature-end <N>`."

### Step 7: Final summary

Wait for all teammates to send their "Feature-end complete for #N" messages.

When all are received, summarise:
- Each issue → PR merged → board/issue closed
- Any notes from individual feature-ends (rebases, review fixes, etc.)

**Only now** is the team fully done. Do not move board items — `/feature-end` handles that.

**Immediately after summarising**, send a shutdown_request to every teammate:
```
SendMessage(to="teammate-<N>", message={"type": "shutdown_request", "reason": "Feature-end complete."})
```
Send all shutdowns in a single message (parallel tool calls). Do not skip this step — teammates
left running consume resources and clutter the user's pane.

## Blocker policy

**Pause and relay to user** if:
- Any issue fails validation (missing design or acceptance criteria)
- A teammate is stuck after 3 attempts on the same error

**Do not pause for:**
- Individual teammate lint/type errors (teammate fixes them)
- PR size slightly over 200 lines (teammate warns in PR, continues)
- One teammate blocked while others are progressing
