# Requirements — Structured Requirements Generation

Takes a discovery document or a freeform brief and produces a structured
requirements document with epics, user stories, acceptance criteria, and
priority ordering. Bridges the gap between problem exploration and project
bootstrap.

```
/discovery  →  /requirements  →  /kickoff  →  /architect  →  /feature
```

For smaller projects without a discovery doc, accepts a freeform prompt or
brief directly.

**Model:** Use Opus (the latest Claude model) for this skill and any sub-agents
it spawns. When launching agents, pass `model: "opus"`.

**Usage:**

- `/requirements` — reads the most recent `docs/discovery/v*-discovery.md`
- `/requirements docs/discovery/v2-discovery.md` — reads a specific discovery
  doc
- `/requirements` (with existing requirements doc) — re-reads the doc,
  addresses `[Review]` comments, and continues from where it stopped
- `/requirements "Brief description of what needs building"` — works from a
  freeform prompt when no discovery doc exists

## When to use

- After `/discovery` has produced a finalised discovery document
- For smaller projects where a full discovery cycle is unnecessary — provide a
  freeform brief instead
- When requirements need a major rewrite for a new version

If structured requirements already exist in `docs/requirements/` and only need
minor updates, edit them directly rather than re-running this skill.

## Inputs and outputs

**Inputs (one of):**

- `docs/discovery/v{N}-discovery.md` — structured discovery document (preferred)
- Freeform brief — a prompt argument describing what needs building (for
  smaller projects)
- Human feedback via `[Review]` inline comments in an existing requirements doc

**Outputs:**

- `docs/requirements/v{N}-requirements.md` — structured requirements document

## Review comments

The human reviewer adds feedback directly in the requirements document using
blockquote markers:

```markdown
> **[Review]:** This story is too broad — split into setup and configuration
```

When the skill is re-invoked (or continues after a gate), it:

1. Scans the document for all `[Review]` markers
2. Addresses each one (update, split, remove, or explain why not)
3. Removes the resolved `[Review]` markers
4. Presents a summary of what changed

## Human gates

**Two** mandatory stop points.

1. **After structure** (Step 3) — glossary, roles, and epic/story structure are
   drafted (titles and one-line descriptions, no ACs yet). The human validates:
   are these the right epics and stories? Is the priority ordering sensible?
2. **After full document** (Step 5) — acceptance criteria are written and
   testability validation is complete. The human validates: are the ACs
   testable and complete?

## Process

Execute these steps sequentially. Use `TodoWrite` to track progress.

### Step 1: Read inputs and orient

1. Determine the input source:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a file path, use that.
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a quoted string or freeform text (not a file
     path), treat it as a brief.
   - Otherwise, find the most recent `docs/discovery/v*-discovery.md` by
     modification date.
2. Read the input fully. Extract:
   - **From a discovery doc:** vision, boundaries (Is / Is Not), personas,
     user journeys, feature catalogue, MVP sequencer.
   - **From a freeform brief:** core concept, target users, stated
     constraints, known scope boundaries, any explicit non-goals.
3. Check for an existing requirements doc
   (`docs/requirements/v*-requirements.md`):
   - If present, check for `[Review]` markers. If found, this is a review
     cycle — jump to the **Review cycle** section below.
   - If present with no markers, confirm with the user: rewrite or update
     specific sections?
4. Check for existing project artefacts (`docs/design/`, `docs/adr/`,
   `docs/plans/`) — if substantial artefacts exist, warn the user that
   requirements changes may drift from existing design. Confirm they want to
   proceed.
5. When prior requirements exist (found in step 1.3), even if doing a rewrite:
   - Read the existing requirements fully.
   - Extract content NOT covered by the discovery doc: design principles,
     anti-scope lists, open questions, concrete interface definitions,
     identity/auth concerns, quality/observability stories.
   - Present a summary of "prior content to carry forward or explicitly defer"
     at the orientation step.
   - The user decides what to include vs. drop.
6. Present a short orientation: what input was found, how many features/
   journeys it contains, and the two-gate process. Wait for user confirmation.

### Step 2: Domain clarification (freeform brief only)

If working from a freeform brief (not a discovery doc), do light research to
fill gaps:

1. Use `WebSearch` for 2–3 targeted searches on the problem domain.
2. Identify likely user roles and primary workflows.
3. Draft a brief scope summary (5–10 bullet points) and present to the user
   for confirmation before proceeding.

Skip this step entirely when working from a discovery doc — that research is
already done.

### Step 3: Draft document structure

Create `docs/requirements/v{N}-requirements.md` with the following sections.
At this stage, epics and stories have titles and one-line descriptions only —
no acceptance criteria yet.

As you work through this step, collect any unresolved questions or ambiguities
into the Open Questions section of the document. Questions discovered during
structuring should be captured immediately. Do not wait for gates to surface
them.

#### Header

```markdown
# <Project Name> — V{N} Requirements

## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Version | 0.1 |
| Status | Draft — Structure |
| Author | LS / Claude |
| Created | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Last updated | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Change Log

| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 0.1 | YYYY-MM-DD | LS / Claude | Initial draft |

---
```

#### Context / Background

1–2 paragraphs explaining why this project/version exists, what it replaces or
builds on, who uses it, and hard constraints. Source from the discovery doc's
vision and boundaries, or from a freeform brief.

```markdown
## Context / Background

<1–2 paragraphs>
```

#### Glossary

Define domain-specific terms used throughout the document. 5–15 entries
typical. Source from the discovery doc's domain research or from the brief.

```markdown
## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Term** | One-line definition |
```

#### Design Principles / Constraints

Numbered list of non-functional constraints that shape all stories. Examples:
tool budget limits, scope model, storage strategy. Source from the discovery
doc's boundaries and any prior requirements doc. These are requirements-level
constraints, not architecture decisions.

```markdown
## Design Principles / Constraints

1. **<Principle name>** — <One-line description of the constraint and why it matters.>
2. ...
```

#### Roles

Identify user roles from personas (discovery) or from the brief. For each:

```markdown
## Roles

| Role | Type | Description |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Role Name** | Persistent / Contextual | What this role does |
```

- **Persistent** roles exist across the system (e.g., Admin, User)
- **Contextual** roles are situational (e.g., Author on a specific PR)

Include notes on role relationships and permission boundaries.

#### Epics and stories (structure only)

Organise features into epics. Each epic groups related stories into a
deliverable capability.

**Priority ordering:** Epics are numbered in priority order (highest first).
Within each epic, stories are numbered in dependency/priority order. State
the rationale for the ordering.

```markdown
## Epic 1: <Name> [Priority: High]

<One paragraph describing the epic's scope and why it's prioritised here.>

### Story 1.1: <Name>

**As a** <role>,
**I want to** <action>,
**so that** <value>.

*(Acceptance criteria in next pass)*

---
```

**Mapping rules:**

- **From discovery doc:** each Wave 1 feature → stories within epics.
  Wave 2 features → separate epics or a "V2" appendix section depending on
  scope. Wave 3+ → out of scope, referenced in a "Future" section.
- **From freeform brief:** identify natural capability groups and create
  epics. If the brief is thin, propose 3–5 epics and ask for confirmation.

#### Cross-cutting concerns

A section for requirements that span multiple epics (security, performance,
observability, accessibility). These become constraints or non-functional
requirements rather than user stories.

```markdown
## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security
- <requirement>

### Performance
- <requirement>

### Observability
- <requirement>
```

#### What We Are NOT Building

Explicit exclusions. Source from discovery boundaries (Is Not column), prior
requirements anti-scope, and anything deliberately deferred. Prevents scope
creep.

```markdown
## What We Are NOT Building

- <Exclusion and why it's out of scope>
```

#### Open Questions

Unresolved decisions needing human input. Collected throughout Steps 1–5.
Each question should state the context, the options considered, and why it
matters.

```markdown
## Open Questions

| # | Question | Context | Options | Impact |
|---|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| 1 | <question> | <why it came up> | <options considered> | <what depends on the answer> |
```

#### Commit

```bash
git add docs/requirements/v{N}-requirements.md
git commit -m "docs: v{N} requirements structure — epics, stories, roles"
```

### Step 3b: Cross-reference validation

Before presenting Gate 1, verify coverage:

1. List every discovery doc feature and check it maps to at least one story
   (or is explicitly deferred to a Wave/Future section).
2. Flag implicit requirements the discovery doc assumes but doesn't state
   (e.g., user identity for multi-user systems, database schema for storage
   products).
3. Flag tensions between wave scoping and technical dependencies (e.g., auth
   deferred to Wave 2 but user_id needed in Wave 1 stories).
4. If prior requirements were absorbed (Step 1.5), verify that
   carried-forward content is reflected in stories or explicitly listed as
   deferred.

Present the cross-reference summary as part of the Gate 1 presentation.

### Gate 1 — Structure review

Present to the user:

- Epic count and priority ordering with rationale
- Story count per epic
- Role summary
- Mapping coverage: which discovery features/journeys are covered, which are
  deferred
- Cross-reference summary from Step 3b
- Any open questions or ambiguities found during structuring

Ask explicitly: **"Are these the right epics and stories? Is the priority
ordering sensible? Any [Review] comments before I write acceptance criteria?"**

**Stop. Wait for explicit user approval.** The user may:

- Approve and continue
- Add `[Review]` comments in the doc and re-invoke `/requirements`
- Reorder priorities, merge/split epics, add/remove stories

If the user says "continue" or "go ahead" without addressing flagged gaps or
open questions, interpret this as approval of the current structure. However,
any gaps you flagged (missing epics, coverage holes, tensions) MUST be recorded
in the Open Questions section — they are not silently dropped. The user can
address them later via `[Review]` comments.

### Step 4: Write acceptance criteria

For each story, write acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format:

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given <precondition>, when <action>, then <outcome>.
- Given <precondition>, when <action>, then <outcome>.
```

As you work through this step, collect any unresolved questions or ambiguities
into the Open Questions section of the document. Questions discovered during
AC writing should be captured immediately. Do not wait for gates to surface
them.

**INVEST check** — as you write each story, verify:

| Property | Check |
|----------|-------|
| **Independent** | Can this story be implemented without requiring another story in the same epic to be done first? If not, note the dependency. |
| **Negotiable** | Are the ACs specific enough to test but flexible enough to allow implementation choices? |
| **Valuable** | Does the story deliver value to at least one role? |
| **Estimable** | Is the scope clear enough that a developer could estimate effort? |
| **Small** | Can this story be implemented in a single PR (< 200 lines)? If not, consider splitting. |
| **Testable** | Does every AC have a clear pass/fail condition? |

Add **Notes** after ACs where useful: technical constraints, references to
discovery findings, dependencies on other stories.

Update the document status:

```markdown
| Status | Draft — Complete |
```

#### Commit

```bash
git add docs/requirements/v{N}-requirements.md
git commit -m "docs: v{N} requirements — acceptance criteria"
```

### Step 5: Testability validation

Scan every acceptance criterion in the document and evaluate testability.
This is the evaluator step — catch problems before they propagate to design
and implementation.

As you work through this step, collect any unresolved questions or ambiguities
into the Open Questions section of the document. Questions discovered during
testability validation should be captured immediately. Do not wait for gates
to surface them.

**For each AC, check:**

1. **Specific outcome** — does the AC state a concrete, observable result?
   Fail: "the system handles errors gracefully." Pass: "given an invalid
   token, the API returns 401 with error body `{error: 'unauthorized'}`."
2. **Precondition clarity** — is the Given clause specific enough to set up
   in a test? Fail: "given a typical user." Pass: "given an authenticated
   user with Org Admin role."
3. **No vague qualifiers** — flag: "appropriate", "reasonable", "user-
   friendly", "fast", "secure" without measurable criteria.
4. **Completeness** — are negative cases covered? (invalid input, permission
   denied, not found, concurrent access)

**Output a testability report** as a table:

```markdown
### Testability Validation

| Epic | Story | AC # | Issue | Suggested fix |
|------|-------|------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | 1.2 | 3 | Vague: "appropriate message" | Specify the message or error code |
| 2 | 2.1 | — | Missing negative case | Add AC for invalid input |
```

If issues are found:

1. Fix them in-place in the requirements document
2. Note the fixes in the change log
3. Commit:
   ```bash
   git add docs/requirements/v{N}-requirements.md
   git commit -m "docs: v{N} requirements — testability fixes"
   ```

If no issues are found, state that explicitly.

### Gate 2 — Full document review

Present to the user:

- Total story count and AC count
- Testability report (issues found and fixed)
- Any stories that were split or merged during AC writing
- INVEST violations found and how they were addressed
- Open questions or ambiguities that need human decision

Ask explicitly: **"Are the acceptance criteria testable and complete? Any
[Review] comments before I finalise?"**

**Stop. Wait for explicit user approval.** The user may:

- Approve — the requirements doc is ready for `/kickoff`
- Add `[Review]` comments and re-invoke `/requirements`
- Request changes to specific ACs or stories

### Step 6: Finalise

After Gate 2 approval:

1. Update the status to `Final` and bump the version
2. Add a "Next steps" section:

```markdown
## Next steps

1. Run `/kickoff docs/requirements/v{N}-requirements.md` to produce HLD,
   ADRs, and implementation plan
```

3. If a V2 / Future section exists, note it as input for future discovery
   cycles
4. Commit:
   ```bash
   git add docs/requirements/v{N}-requirements.md
   git commit -m "docs: finalise v{N} requirements"
   ```
5. Report to the user: what was produced, key decisions, and suggested next
   step.

**Stop here.** Do not proceed to `/kickoff` automatically.

---

## Review cycle

When re-invoked on a requirements doc that has `[Review]` markers:

1. Read the full document
2. Grep for `> **[Review]:**` markers
3. For each marker:
   - Read the comment and the surrounding context
   - Determine the appropriate action: update AC, split story, merge stories,
     reprioritise, add missing case, or push back with reasoning
   - Apply the change
   - Remove the `[Review]` marker
4. Present a summary: which markers were found, what changed for each
5. If the document was at Gate 1 (status: `Draft — Structure`), continue to
   Step 4
6. If the document was at Gate 2 (status: `Draft — Complete`), re-run
   testability validation (Step 5) and re-present Gate 2 summary
7. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add docs/requirements/v{N}-requirements.md
   git commit -m "docs: address requirements review comments"
   ```

---

## Output format reference

The output follows the format established by `docs/requirements/v1-requirements.md`.
Key conventions:

- Epics are numbered sequentially: `## Epic 1:`, `## Epic 2:`
- Stories use dotted numbering within their epic: `### Story 1.1:`,
  `### Story 1.2:`
- ACs use Given/When/Then in bullet list format
- Notes and technical mechanism sections appear after ACs where relevant
- Cross-cutting concerns appear after all epics
- V2/Future items appear in an appendix section, clearly separated from V1
  scope
- Change log tracks every revision with version, date, author, and summary

## Guidelines

- **Requirements, not design.** This skill produces what the system must do,
  not how it's built internally. No components, no class hierarchies, no
  internal architecture. However, when the product surface IS an interface
  (API tools, CLI commands, config schemas), naming those interfaces and their
  parameters is a requirement, not a design choice. Include concrete interface
  definitions when the product is defined by its interfaces.
- **Discovery informs, does not dictate.** The discovery doc is input, not
  gospel. Challenge feature priorities, split oversized features, and add
  missing cases. The requirements doc is the authoritative scope statement.
- **INVEST is a lens, not a ceremony.** Check properties as you write. Do
  not produce a separate INVEST compliance report — fix issues inline.
- **Priority is a point of view.** State the rationale for epic ordering
  explicitly so the human can challenge it. Consider: user value, technical
  dependency, risk reduction, and learning value.
- **Testable means automatable.** Every AC should be expressible as an
  automated test. If you cannot describe the test setup and assertion, the
  AC is too vague.
- **British English** in all documentation.
- **Small stories.** Target stories that fit in a single PR (< 200 lines).
  If a story feels large, split it. Prefer more small stories over fewer
  large ones.
- **Negative cases matter.** For every happy-path AC, consider: what happens
  with invalid input? Missing permissions? Concurrent access? Network
  failure? Not every story needs all of these, but the omission should be
  deliberate.
- **Do not invent requirements.** If the discovery doc or brief is ambiguous,
  stop and ask the user rather than inferring. Flag ambiguities in the Gate
  presentations.
- **Keep it proportional.** A small project gets a concise requirements doc.
  Do not inflate three features into enterprise-scale epics.
- **Reference, do not duplicate.** Point to the discovery doc for background
  context rather than restating research findings.
- **No Co-Authored-By trailers** in commit messages.
