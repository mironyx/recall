# Feature End — Post-Review Wrap-Up

Finalises a feature branch after the PR has been reviewed and approved. Handles session log, final commit, merge, and cleanup.

**Pre-requisite:** A PR exists for the current branch (or the given issue) and has been reviewed/approved.

**Usage:**
- `/feature-end` — detects the PR from the current branch (original behaviour)
- `/feature-end <issue-number>` — looks up the PR for the given issue. If an orphaned worktree exists (crashed teammate), switches into it and recovers. Otherwise checks out the branch (used by `/feature-team` lead when triggering remotely via message).

## Process

Execute these steps sequentially. Do not skip steps.

**Autonomy rule:** Invoking `/feature-end` IS the user's approval to merge and clean up. Do not stop to ask for merge confirmation, do not ask "ready to merge?", do not wait for "approved" — run all steps straight through. Only stop for the conditions listed under **Blocker policy** at the end of this file.

### Step 1: Gather context

If an issue number argument was provided:
1. Find the PR for the issue:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --search "closes #<issue-number>" --json number,title,baseRefName,state,url,headRefName --state open
   ```
   If no open PR is found, try `--state merged` in case it was already merged. If still none, stop and report.
2. Extract the head branch (`headRefName`) and read the session ID — PR body first, prom file as fallback:
   ```bash
   OLD_SESSION_ID=$(gh pr view <pr-number> --json body --jq '.body' | python3 -c "
   import sys, re
   m = re.search(r'claude-session-id: ([a-f0-9-]+)', sys.stdin.read())
   print(m.group(1) if m else '')
   ")

   # Fallback: read from prom file (covers PRs created before session-ID embedding was added)
   if [ -z "$OLD_SESSION_ID" ]; then
     OLD_SESSION_ID=$(python3 -c "
   import re, pathlib, os, subprocess
   result = subprocess.run(['git', 'rev-parse', '--git-common-dir'], capture_output=True, text=True)
   root = pathlib.Path(result.stdout.strip()).parent.resolve()
   prom_dir = pathlib.Path(os.environ.get('RECALL_FEATURE_PROM_DIR') or root / 'monitoring' / 'textfile_collector')
   prom = prom_dir / 'session_feature.prom'
   if prom.exists():
       m = re.search(r'session_id=\"([^\"]+)\",feature_id=\"RECALL-<issue-number>\"', prom.read_text())
       print(m.group(1) if m else '')
   else:
       print('')
   ")
   fi
   ```
3. Detect an orphaned worktree — a worktree on that branch left behind by a crashed teammate:
   ```bash
   MAIN_REPO=$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)")
   ORPHAN_WORKTREE=$(git worktree list | python3 -c "
   import sys
   lines = sys.stdin.read().strip().splitlines()
   for line in lines:
       parts = line.split()
       if len(parts) >= 3 and parts[2] == '[<head-branch>]' and parts[0] != '$MAIN_REPO':
           print(parts[0])
           break
   ")
   ```
4. **If an orphaned worktree is found (crash recovery mode):**
   - Switch into it and register this recovery session under the same feature ID for cost aggregation:
     ```bash
     cd "$ORPHAN_WORKTREE"
     .claude/hooks/run-python.sh scripts/tag-session.py <issue-number> --cont
     ```
   - Proceed with all remaining steps from inside the worktree. `IS_WORKTREE=yes` will be detected automatically in Step 5+6, which handles self-cleanup.
5. **If no orphaned worktree is found** (normal mode — e.g. triggered by lead via SendMessage):
   ```bash
   gh pr checkout <pr-number>
   ```

If no argument was provided (original behaviour):
1. Identify the current branch: `git branch --show-current`.
2. Find the open PR for this branch: `gh pr view --json number,title,baseRefName,state,reviews,url`.
   - If no PR exists, stop and report: "No open PR found for the current branch."

In both cases:
- Extract the **base branch**, **PR number**, and **URL**.
- Find the associated issue number from the PR body (look for `Closes #N` or `#N` references).
- **Check review status:** `gh pr view <number> --json reviewDecision --jq .reviewDecision`. If the result is `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, stop and report per the Blocker policy. (Empty/null or `APPROVED` are fine — repos without required reviews will return empty.)
- Read the latest session log in `docs/sessions/` to understand what has been done this session. **Skip this in crash recovery mode** (`OLD_SESSION_ID` set) — the JSONL read in Step 2 provides the implementation history instead.

### Step 1.5: Sync the LLD — MANDATORY

**Idempotency check:** Before running, check whether lld-sync was already completed this run:
```bash
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD | grep -i "lld-sync\|lld sync" | head -1
```
If a matching commit exists, skip this step and note "lld-sync already committed" in the session log.

Otherwise run `/lld-sync <issue-number>` to update the Low-Level Design document with
implementation learnings before writing the session log. The sync report feeds directly into the
session log's "Decisions made" section.

Only skip if no LLD covers this issue (chore or infrastructure task) — note the skip in the
session log.

### Step 2: Write session log — MANDATORY

**Idempotency check:** Before writing, check whether a session log for this issue already exists:
```bash
grep -rl "#<issue-number>\|closes #<issue-number>" docs/sessions/ 2>/dev/null | head -1
```
If a matching file exists, skip writing and proceed to Step 2.5.

**Do not skip.** A session log must always be written, even for small changes.

1. Check for a compact draft: `ls docs/sessions/*-draft.md 2>/dev/null | tail -1`.
   - If a draft exists, read it — it contains pre-compact snapshots with tool counts, files
     touched, agent spawns, and git milestones captured automatically before context was lost.
     Use this data to populate the cost retrospective (Step 2.6) with actual numbers rather
     than estimates. The final session log filename should match the draft name minus `-draft`
     (e.g., `2026-03-26-session-3-draft.md` → `2026-03-26-session-3.md`).
   - If no draft exists, determine the filename as `YYYY-MM-DD-session-N-<slug>.md` where N increments from the latest log for today and `<slug>` is a short kebab-case label derived from the issue title (e.g. issue #130 "show rubric_generation status" → `rubric-generation-status`).

1a. **Crash recovery only** — if `OLD_SESSION_ID` is set and non-empty, recover the original session's implementation history from its JSONL:
   ```python
   import json, pathlib, subprocess, os, re

   result = subprocess.run(['git', 'rev-parse', '--git-common-dir'], capture_output=True, text=True)
   root = pathlib.Path(result.stdout.strip()).parent.resolve()
   path_str = str(root).lower().replace(":\\", "--").replace("\\", "-").replace("/", "-").replace(":", "")
   jsonl_path = pathlib.Path.home() / '.claude' / 'projects' / path_str / f'{OLD_SESSION_ID}.jsonl'

   if jsonl_path.exists():
       events = [json.loads(l) for l in jsonl_path.read_text().splitlines() if l.strip()]
       # Extract: file writes/edits (tool_use name in Write/Edit/MultiEdit),
       # test run results (Bash with pytest/mypy/ruff), assistant reasoning messages,
       # and any tool_result content showing pass/fail outcomes.
       # Use this as the primary source for "Work completed" and "Decisions made".
   ```
   Note in the session log: _"Session recovered from crashed teammate (original session: `<OLD_SESSION_ID>`)."_

2. Write the session log capturing:
   - Work completed (reference issue number and PR)
   - Decisions made during the session
   - Any review feedback addressed
   - Next steps or follow-up items
   - Final feature cost (from Step 2.5) — include both the PR-creation cost (from PR body) and the final total, so the delta is visible
3. If a draft file was used, delete it: `rm docs/sessions/*-draft.md`.
4. Stage the session log (and the draft deletion if applicable).

### Step 2.5: Query final feature cost

**Idempotency check:** Skip if the `ai-cost-final` label is already on the issue:
```bash
gh issue view <issue-number> --json labels --jq '.labels[].name' | grep -q "^ai-cost-final" && echo "SKIP" || echo "RUN"
```
If `SKIP`, note "cost already labelled" in the session log and proceed to Step 2.6.

Query Prometheus for the full feature total (all sessions since `/feature` started — same
session IDs registered in the textfile). This is the **final** cost snapshot; comparing it
to the cost recorded in the PR body at creation time shows how much effort was spent
post-PR (review fixes, re-runs, etc.). Applies `ai-cost-final:*`, `input-tokens-final:*`, and `output-tokens-final:*` labels to the issue and PR (complementing the `*-pr` labels written at PR creation).

Derive the issue number from the git log and run the shared script:

```bash
ISSUE=$(git log --oneline -10 | grep -o '#[0-9]*' | head -1 | tr -d '#')
PR=$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number 2>/dev/null || echo "")
COST_OUTPUT=$(.claude/hooks/run-python.sh scripts/query-feature-cost.py RECALL-$ISSUE --issue $ISSUE ${PR:+--pr $PR} --stage final)
echo "$COST_OUTPUT"
```

Post the output as a PR comment:

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body "$COST_OUTPUT"
```

Store the cost figures — you will include them in the session log in Step 2.

### Step 2.6: Cost retrospective

Analyse the full cost and write a brief retrospective to include in the session log.
This is the institutional memory that makes future features cheaper.

1. **Cost summary:** PR-creation cost (from PR body `Usage` section) vs final total.
   Delta = post-PR work (review fixes, re-runs, extra commits).

2. **Identify cost drivers.** Check each of these against the git log and session history:

   | Driver | How to detect | Typical impact |
   |--------|--------------|----------------|
   | Context compaction | Session summary starts "This session is being continued..." | High — re-summarising inflates cache-write tokens |
   | Fix cycles (RED→fix rounds) | Count commits before the first green run | Medium — each pytest run adds tokens |
   | Agent spawns | Count Agent calls in the session: simplify (3), pr-review (3), diagnostics, ci-probe | Medium — each spawn re-sends the full diff |
   | LLD quality gaps | pr-review found design-contract violations → extra fix commit | Medium — avoidable with better LLD signatures upfront |
   | Mock complexity | Many test fix rounds before mocks worked | Low–medium |
   | Pydantic/framework version gotchas | Fix cycles on schema/type issues | Low |

3. **Improvement actions:** For each driver, record a concrete change for next time:
   - "LLD private-helper signatures were wrong → validate signatures in a quick `mypy` pass before writing tests"
   - "Context compaction hit → keep PRs under 200 lines; break large features into two issues"
   - "3 simplify agents re-read the full diff → run simplify before pr-review, not both"
   - "Pydantic v2 model_validate → read migration notes at session start for framework upgrades"

Record under **## Cost retrospective** in the session log.

### Step 3: Commit remaining changes

1. Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes (session log, review fixes, etc.).
2. If there are changes to commit:
   ```bash
   git add <specific-files>
   git commit -m "docs: session log and final fixes #<issue-number>"
   ```
3. Push to remote: `git push`.

### Step 3.5: Rebase onto latest base branch

With multiple agents working in parallel, the base branch may have advanced since this branch was cut.
Rebase before merging so CI validates the integrated code and the merge is conflict-free.

```bash
BASE=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName)
git fetch origin "$BASE"
git merge-base --is-ancestor "origin/$BASE" HEAD \
  && echo "ALREADY_UP_TO_DATE" \
  || (git rebase "origin/$BASE" && git push --force-with-lease && echo "REBASED_AND_PUSHED")
```

- **Already up to date** (`ALREADY_UP_TO_DATE`) → proceed directly to Step 4.
- **Rebased cleanly** (`REBASED_AND_PUSHED`) → proceed to Step 4. CI will re-run on the rebased commit; wait for it to pass before merging (use `gh run watch`).
- **Rebase conflict** (non-zero exit from `git rebase`) → run `git rebase --abort`, stop, and report the conflicting files to the user. Do not attempt to resolve conflicts automatically.

### Step 4: Merge the PR

First check whether the PR is already merged (user may have merged via GitHub UI):
```bash
gh pr view <number> --json state
```
Parse the `state` field from the raw JSON output. If `"state":"MERGED"`, skip the merge command and proceed directly to Step 5.

Otherwise merge immediately — **no user prompt**. Invoking `/feature-end` is itself the approval:

```bash
gh pr merge <number> --squash 2>&1 || true
# Do NOT pass --delete-branch here — deleting the local branch ref while inside the worktree
# makes the worktree prunable; if git worktree prune runs (hook or concurrent process) the
# directory disappears and all subsequent Bash calls fail. Branch deletion is handled in Step 5+6
# after cd-ing to the main repo. Verify the merge succeeded:
gh pr view <number> --json state --jq .state
```

If the state is `MERGED`, proceed. If it is still `OPEN` (merge genuinely failed), stop and report per the Blocker policy.

**All steps must run automatically without user approval — only stop for a real blocker.**
### Step 5 + 6: Clean up, sync, and update project board

Read the issue state from the earlier `gh pr view` output (merged PRs close the issue automatically).
Chain **all** of cleanup + board update into a **single Bash call** to minimise approval prompts:

**Worktree detection:** If running inside a linked worktree (parallel mode), the cleanup must
happen from the main repo — you cannot remove a worktree from within itself. Detect and handle:

```bash
WORKTREE_PATH=$(pwd)
MAIN_REPO=$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)")
IS_WORKTREE=$([ "$WORKTREE_PATH" != "$MAIN_REPO" ] && echo "yes" || echo "no")
```

Then chain all cleanup in a **single Bash call**:

```bash
# If in a worktree: cd to main repo first, then clean up worktree + branch
# If in main repo: standard cleanup (git branch -d works directly)

cd "$MAIN_REPO" && git pull --rebase \
  && { [ "$IS_WORKTREE" = "yes" ] && git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH" --force 2>&1 || true; } \
  && { git branch -d <feature-branch> 2>&1 || true; } \
  && { bash scripts/gh-project-status.sh <issue-number> done 2>&1 || true; } \
  && { gh issue close <issue-number> 2>&1 || true; }
```

The `|| true` inside `{ }` groups ensures:
- Not in a worktree — `git worktree remove` skipped cleanly.
- A missing local branch does not abort the chain.
- A board item already at Done (script exits 0 with no-op) continues cleanly.
- An already-closed issue (`gh issue close` 422) is silently ignored.
- If `cd` or `git pull` fails, the chain **stops** rather than running from the wrong directory.

**Do not run separate Bash calls** for branch delete, board update, and issue close — they must be one call.

### Step 6.5: Tick the parent epic checklist

If the closed issue has a parent epic, tick its checkbox in the epic body.

1. Read the issue body to find the parent epic number:
   ```bash
   EPIC=$(gh issue view <issue-number> --json body --jq '.body' | python3 -c "
   import sys, re
   m = re.search(r'## Parent epic\s*\n+#(\d+)', sys.stdin.read())
   print(m.group(1) if m else '')
   ")
   ```

2. If `EPIC` is non-empty, read the epic body and tick the checkbox for this issue:
   ```bash
   if [ -n "$EPIC" ]; then
     EPIC_BODY=$(gh issue view "$EPIC" --json body --jq '.body')
     UPDATED=$(echo "$EPIC_BODY" | python3 -c "
   import sys, re
   issue = '<issue-number>'
   body = sys.stdin.read()
   body = re.sub(
       r'- \[ \] (#' + issue + r'\b)',
       r'- [x] \1',
       body
   )
   print(body, end='')
   ")
     gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$EPIC" --method PATCH -f body="$UPDATED" > /dev/null \
       && echo "Epic #$EPIC: checked off #<issue-number>"
   fi
   ```

3. If no `## Parent epic` section exists (chore or standalone task), skip silently.

### Step 7: Report

Summarise what was done:
- PR merged (link)
- Issue closed
- Now on branch `<base-branch>`, up to date with remote
- Suggested next item: run `gh issue list --label kind:task --state open --limit 3` and print the results. This is the only additional query allowed here.

## Blocker policy

**Pause and report** if:

- No open PR exists for the current branch
- PR has not been approved / has requested changes
- Merge conflicts prevent merging
- Push fails

**Do NOT pause for:**

- Missing session log (create one)
- Minor uncommitted changes (commit them)
- Issue already closed by GitHub on merge (skip close step)
- Board item already moved to Done by GitHub on merge (skip board update)
- Local feature branch already deleted (skip `git branch -d`)
